# My first .NET project

This is my first .NET project. I'm using it to learn C# and .NET6. I am actually a front-end developer, but I would like to understand better how .NET works, mostly of my job these days are consuming REST APIs written with .NET. Plus, who knows? It is always interesting learn! I am using VSCode + extensions.

The ideia is to evolve this repo saving each step in a different branch.

## Dependencies

- .NET6 SDK
