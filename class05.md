# Class 05

## 1. Structs

- data structures that are value types and don't alocate heap;
- struct types saves data directly;
- it has methods and members like classes;
- structs doesn't accepts inheritances;
- useful for small structures;
- best when it has the need for value itself;
- best uses: complex numbers, coordinate system, key-value pairs etc;
- it helps to use less memory;

## 2. Interfaces

- it is a contract;
- it could be implemented by classes and structs;
- it could have methods, properties, events and index;
- generally it contains just de method signature;
- it could implement multiple inheritances;

-> check IOC - Inversion of Control
-> Dependency Injection

## 3. Enums

- value type;
- a type with a group of values;
- it deliveries semantic meaning to the discrete values;
